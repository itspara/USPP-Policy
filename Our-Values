The policies of the United States Pirate Party are based upon 7 simple principles enshrined in our constitution that guide our approach to all aspects of governance. Our principles are the basis of our political agenda and can be applied to any and all areas of public and private life. They determine whether we can or cannot support a specific initiative or politician and they should be sufficient to determine our position on any number of issues, whether outlined as policy or not:

1.We stand for open culture. No one should have the power to prevent the free exchange and expression of ideas, tools, or works.
2.We stand for transparency and openness. Government activities should not be hidden from the public.
3.We stand for individual privacy. The amount of oppression in a society is inversely proportional to its privacy protections. Individuals must be free to make personal decisions that do not harm another person.
4.We are anti-monopoly. No monopoly should be able to prevent works, tools, or ideas from: being freely used, expressed, exchanged, recombined, or taught; nor to violate individual privacy or human rights. A creator's right to be compensated for their work or idea is only acceptable within these limitations.
5.We stand for individuals over institutions. Universal human rights apply only to human beings, and not to corporations, limited liability organizations, or other group entities.
6.We are a post-ideological values-based meritocracy. We place all options on the table. We choose a specific approach because the available evidence shows that it is the best way to promote our values. We do not make decisions based merely on tradition, popularity, authority or political expediency.
7.We are egalitarian. We believe in equality and a level playing field. We accept input from all sources, and we value all people equally.
